<h4>
Storing artwork is a complex process. There are many considerations to ensure that each piece is accounted for, and stored safely. This can be a nightmare for inventories of any size, but especially for larger ones. Navigating through hundreds or thousands of art pieces is not practical, and in order to maintain artwork integrity, many pieces are intentionally not easily accessible. We wish to develop a cataloging application that organizes these inventories into a manageable and user-friendly system. This system would give art storage facilities and artists alike the ability to keep track of their collections and any important information pertaining to their artwork.
